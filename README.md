During the 2017 iText All Hands Meeting, some of us played the infamous party
game [Cards Against Humanity][1]. We had the crazy idea to create a PDF themed
card deck as an add-on for CaH.

This project has two goals:

 1. A set of PDF of iText related black (questions) and white (answers) cards.
 2. An iText-based application to generate custom Cards against Humanity cards
    with the correct dimensions.

---

 * `black.csv` contains questions.
 * `white.csv` contains answers.
 * A single `_` is used for a default blank.
 * Multiple underline characters are used for custom blank lengths.
 * HTML can be used for formatting.
