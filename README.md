During the 2017 iText All Hands Meeting, some of us played the infamous party
game [Cards Against Humanity][1]. We had the crazy idea to create a PDF themed
card deck as an add-on for CaH.

This project has two goals:

 1. A set of PDF of iText related black (questions) and white (answers) cards.
 2. An iText-based application to generate custom Cards against Humanity cards
    with the correct dimensions.
